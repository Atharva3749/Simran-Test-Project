                        <li>Lockout/Tagout (LOTO): Electrical safety training teaches workers to implement the LOTO procedure, which prevents machines or equipment from being energized while maintenance or repairs are being conducted. This is essential for protecting workers from accidental electrical contact.</li>
                        <li>Inspecting Equipment: Workers learn to inspect electrical tools, cords, and systems for damage or wear, reducing the risk of electrical accidents caused by faulty equipment.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Recognizing Electrical Hazards: Training helps workers identify potential hazards, such as exposed wiring, overloaded circuits, and faulty equipment. By recognizing these risks, workers can take corrective actions to prevent accidents.</li>
                        <li>Risk Assessment: Electrical safety training includes performing risk assessments before starting electrical work. This ensures that workers identify dangers and implement appropriate controls, such as de-energizing equipment or using PPE.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Emergency Response Preparedness:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Electrical Incident Response: Training ensures workers know how to respond to electrical incidents, such as shutting off power sources, calling for emergency assistance, and administering first aid in case of electrical shock.</li>
                        <li>Firefighting Skills: Electrical safety training teaches workers how to safely use fire extinguishers and other equipment to fight electrical fires, which require special handling compared to ordinary fires.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Safe Work Practices:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Electrical safety training instructs workers on using appropriate PPE, such as insulated gloves, arc-rated clothing, and face shields, to protect themselves from electrical hazards.</li>
                        <li>Safe Distance and Barriers: Workers learn to maintain safe distances from energized equipment and how to use protective barriers and insulation to avoid accidental contact.</li>
                        <li>Grounding and Bonding: Proper grounding and bonding of electrical systems and equipment are essential for reducing the risk of electrical shock. Training ensures workers understand these concepts and apply them correctly in their tasks.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Employer Liability and Costs:</strong>
